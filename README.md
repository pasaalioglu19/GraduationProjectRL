# Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a single-player action game featuring AI-controlled boss characters that use reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt to player strategies. The goal is to create dynamic and challenging encounters by allowing the bosses to learn from player actions, ensuring each battle feels unique and exciting.

Traditional AI systems in games are often predictable and repetitive. This project aims to solve that by using RL, enabling the bosses to adjust their behavior based on the player's actions, providing a more engaging gameplay experience. The game is developed using Unreal Engine, with basic RL algorithms implemented for initial testing and more advanced methods to be added as the project progresses.

## Key Features:
- Adaptive boss characters that evolve their strategies based on player actions.
- Development using Unreal Engine for immersive gameplay.
- Aiming to push the boundaries of traditional game AI with RL-powered behavior.

While RL offers great potential for enhancing game AI, it also comes with challenges such as the need for significant computing power and ensuring balanced difficulty. The final goal is to create a functional game prototype with at least one adaptive boss character.
