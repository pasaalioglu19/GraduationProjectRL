 This project aims to develop a single-player action game that combines artificial in
telligence techniques with modern game development technologies. The main idea of
 the project is to create advanced boss characters that can adapt to the player’s actions
 and strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. With RL integration,
 the boss characters will learn to fight better after each encounter with the player and
 dynamically adjust their behavior. This will provide players with a more competitive
 and enjoyable gaming experience.
 The game will be developed using Unreal Engine. This game development platform
 offers advanced tools to create visually impressive environments and design complex
 game mechanics. Reinforcement learning algorithms will allow the boss characters to
 analyze player behavior in real time and respond with more effective strategies. This
 approach aims to go beyond traditional AI systems and provide a more engaging and
 personalized gaming experience.
 One of the main goals of the project is to ensure a smooth and balanced interaction
 between the player and the AI-controlled bosses. This includes designing the behavior
 of the bosses to provide an appropriate level of challenge without being too predictable
 or too difficult. By using reinforcement learning, the player’s decisions and fighting
 style will play a central role in the game’s difficulty and progression.
 The project also comes with certain challenges. Training RL models can require a
 lot of computing power and time, especially considering game development deadlines
 and hardware limitations. Additionally, balancing the adaptability of the bosses to
 make them challenging but not impossible to beat is a complex task. Despite these
 challenges, the project aims to deliver a fully playable prototype with at least one
 adaptive boss character, supported by a dynamic game environment.
 This project not only aims to show the potential of reinforcement learning in modern
 game design but also demonstrates how adaptive and intelligent AI behaviors can
 improve the player experience. By strengthening the connection between academic
 research in artificial intelligence and game development practices, this project aims to
 contribute both to the AI field and to the world of interactive entertainment.
